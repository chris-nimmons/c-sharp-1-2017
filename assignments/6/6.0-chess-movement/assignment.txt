Create chess classes for each piece.  Add a method on to the individual chess piece classes named GetMoves.
Return a list of moves from GetMoves method.  
Upon selection of a piece show the moves.  
Only allow the piece to move to the moves show.  
The moves list should work for any position on the 20 x 20 theoretical board and 
should not overflow the board with moves.
